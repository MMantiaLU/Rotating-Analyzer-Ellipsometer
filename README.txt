The folder "STEP Files" contains the .STEP-formatted 3D model files of the opto-mechanical componentry which construct the 3D-printed RAE. STEP files are widely compatible with CAD programs and can be used to analyze dimensions or make modifications to the components.

The folder "STL Files" contains the .STL-formatted stereolithographic files of the opto-mechanical componentry which construct the 3D-printed RAE. STL Files are ready to be imported into a "slicer" program (such as Ultimaker Cura) which converts them into GCODE files appropriate for 3D printing.

"Calibrating the Rotating Polarizer Mounts.pdf" is an instructional document which details two simple methods for calibrating 3D-printed rotating polarizer mounts. Two of these mounts are required for the RAE, one becoming the fixed polarizer, and one becoming the rotating analyzer. Calibration aligns the transmission angle of the polarizer with the plane of incidence and involves manually graduating the four critical angles (0, +45, 90, and -45) for use with the RAE.

"Constructing the 3D Printed RAE.pdf" is an instructional document which details the assembly of the 3D-printed RAE, including a list of parts both 3D printed and non-printed. Also provided at the end of the document is guidance for making custom "Light Source" and "Light Sensor" mounts.

"Ellipsometer Data Collection and Modeling.xlsx" is a Microsoft Excel document that allows one to experimentally determine thin film properties using intensity measurements collected with the 3D-printed RAE. Instructions on using the document are built-in to the first page. The model's regressive fitting process requires Excel's Solver add-on be enabled in the settings.

"Ellipsometry, Jesper Jung et al., Aalborg University (2004).pdf" is a copy of the "Ellipsometry" (Reference 9) project report obtained from <http://homes.nano.aau.dk/kp/Ellipsometry/main.pdf>. This report is included as a backup of the original source, as it contains valuable discussion and derivations for ellipsometric theory. Permission for redistribution was obtained by the authors.
